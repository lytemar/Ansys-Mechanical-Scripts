# ANSYS Mechanical Scripts

Python scripts for automating Ansys Mechanical

## About

These scripts automate some common operations in Ansys Mechanical version 2021 R2 or later.
Earlier versions of Ansys very likely work, but may require some tweaks.
As of this time, Ansys uses IronPython 2.7 for its scripting language, and importing of popular Python libraries like NumPy, etc., are very tricky to use with IronPython.
